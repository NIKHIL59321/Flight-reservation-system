# Flight-reservation-system
Introduction:
A flight reservation system is an essential digital tool that enables users to search for, book, and manage airline tickets. This mini project aims to develop a user-friendly flight reservation system with six main tabs: Home, Book Your Flight, My Bookings, Contact Us, Help, and User Account. Each tab serves a specific function to ensure a seamless experience for users.

Home:
The Home tab is the main landing page, designed to welcome users and provide quick access to the system's features. It includes a search bar for immediate flight searches, promotional banners for current deals, and links to featured destinations. The home page also offers navigation links to other sections like Book Your Flight, My Bookings, and User Account. Additionally, it may include customer testimonials, news, and updates about new routes or special offers.

Book Your Flight:
The Book Your Flight tab is the core functionality of the system. Users can enter their travel details such as departure and arrival cities, travel dates, and the number of passengers. The system then displays a list of available flights with options to filter and sort by price, duration, or airline. Users can select their preferred flights, view fare details, and proceed to booking. The booking process includes entering passenger information, selecting seats, and making payments securely through various payment methods.

My Bookings:
The My Bookings tab allows users to view and manage their existing reservations. Users can see a list of their booked flights, along with details such as flight numbers, departure and arrival times, and booking status. This section also provides options to modify or cancel bookings, if necessary. Users can easily access their booking history and keep track of their travel plans.

Contact Us:
The Contact Us tab provides users with various ways to get in touch with customer support. This section includes contact information such as phone numbers, email addresses, and a contact form for submitting inquiries. Users can also find information about the company’s physical office locations and operating hours. The goal is to ensure that users can easily reach out for assistance whenever needed.

Help:
The Help tab offers a comprehensive FAQ section and user guides to assist users with common questions and issues. This section covers topics such as booking procedures, payment methods, cancellation policies, and more. The help section is designed to be a self-service resource, enabling users to find answers to their questions without needing to contact customer support.


User Account:
The User Account tab allows users to manage their personal information and preferences. Users can update their contact details, change their passwords, and view their booking history. This section also provides options for managing payment methods and setting travel preferences. The user account section ensures that users have control over their personal data and can customize their experience.
This flight reservation system aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for managing flight bookings. By offering a range of features and easy navigation, the system ensures a smooth and efficient experience for travelers.
